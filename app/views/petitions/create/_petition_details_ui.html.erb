      <p>What do you want the government to do and why? Write as briefly and clearly as you can.</p>
      <p>Here are some examples of well-written titles:</p>
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>"End non-stun slaughter to promote animal welfare"</li>
        <li>"Introduce Black History to the primary curriculum"</li>
        <li>"Don't increase MPs' salaries - they are well-paid already"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You don't need to say "Petition to...", "Call on the government to..." or "We the undersigned...".</p>
      <p>Here are some examples of badly-written titles:</p>
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>"Jack's law"</li>
        <li>"Russia Problem on US ruling"</li>
        <li>"Justice for David Thomas"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In each case, it’s not clear what the government is being asked to do or why.</p>
      <p>Don't write in all caps. It's harder to read.</p>
      <p>You’re limited to 80 characters here. You can add more in the next step.</p>
