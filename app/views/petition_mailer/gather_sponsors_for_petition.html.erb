<p>Dear <%= @creator.name %>,</p>

<p>Before your petition is passed to parliament for moderation review you must gather support from at least <%= AppConfig.sponsor_moderation_threshold %> sponsors.</p>

<p>To gather sponsors give out this url to people you think might want to support your petition:</p>

<%= link_to nil, petition_sponsor_url(@petition, token: @petition.sponsor_token) %>

<p>When they visit this url they will be asked to fill in their details and sign the petition as a sponsor.</p>

<p>You will be notified when people sign as a sponsor and kept up-to-date with your progress towards gathering the <%= AppConfig.sponsor_moderation_threshold %> sponsors you need to go into moderation review.</p>

<p>You should consider sending your chosen sponsors the full text of the petition so they can review it and be sure they agree with you before signing it as a sponsor.</p>

<p><b>Title</b>: <%= @petition.title %></p>
<p><b>Action</b>: <%= @petition.action %></p>
<p><b>Full description</b>: <%= @petition.description %></p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
