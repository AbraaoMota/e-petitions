<p>Dear <%= @signature.name %>,</p>

<p>Unfortunately we've had to bring forward the closing date of your petition <%= link_to @signature.petition.action, petition_url(@signature.petition) %> from  <%= short_date_format @signature.petition.deadline %> to 30 March 2015</p>

<p>The dissolution of this Parliament has now been scheduled for 30 March 2015, and itâ€™s not possible for petitions to remain open once Parliament has been dissolved.</p>

<p>I'm sorry you won't have as long to collect signatures as you expected. If you have any questions about this change, please <%= link_to 'contact us', 'https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/feedback' %> at https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/feedback</p>

<p>(Please don't reply to this message as it's not an email address we monitor)</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
