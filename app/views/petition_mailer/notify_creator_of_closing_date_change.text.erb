Dear <%= @signature.name %>,

Unfortunately we've had to bring forward the closing date of your petition "<%= @signature.petition.action %>" (available at <%= petition_url(@signature.petition) %>) from  <%= short_date_format @signature.petition.deadline %> to 31 March 2015

The dissolution of this Parliament has now been scheduled for 30 March 2015, and itâ€™s not possible for petitions to remain open once Parliament has been dissolved.

I'm sorry you won't have as long to collect signatures as you expected. If you have any questions about this change, please contact us at https://submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/feedback

(Please don't reply to this message as it's not an email address we monitor)

Thanks,

<%= t("petitions.emails.signoff_prefix") %> <%= home_url %>
