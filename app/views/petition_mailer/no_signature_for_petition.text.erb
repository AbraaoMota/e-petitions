Hi,

We donâ€™t think anyone has signed the petition using this email address: <%= @email %>.

Maybe you used a different email address?

If you still want to sign the petition "<%= @petition.action %>", click this link: <%= petition_url(@petition) %>

Ignore this email if you think it was sent to you by mistake.

Thanks,
