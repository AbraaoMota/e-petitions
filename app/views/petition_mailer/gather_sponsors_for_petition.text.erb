Dear <%= @creator.name %>,

Before your petition is passed to parliament for moderation review you must gather support from at least <%= Site.threshold_for_moderation %> sponsors.

To gather sponsors give out this url to people you think might want to support your petition:

<%= petition_sponsor_url(@petition, token: @petition.sponsor_token) %>

When they visit this url they will be asked to fill in their details and sign the petition as a sponsor.

You will be notified when people sign as a sponsor and kept up-to-date with your progress towards gathering the <%= Site.threshold_for_moderation %> sponsors you need to go into moderation review.

You should consider sending your chosen sponsors the full text of the petition so they can review it and be sure they agree with you before signing it as a sponsor.

Title: <%= @petition.title %>
Action: <%= @petition.action %>
Full description: <%= @petition.description %>

Thanks,

<%= t("petitions.emails.signoff_prefix") %> <%= home_url %>
