<h1 class="page-title">How petitions work</h1>

<ol class="list-number">
  <li>You create a petition. Only British citizens and UK residents can create or sign a petition.</li>
  <li>You get 5 people to support your petition. We’ll tell you how to do this when you’ve created your petition.</li>
  <li>We check your petition, then publish it. We only reject petitions that don’t meet the standards for petitions.</li>
  <li>The <a href="#petitions-committee">Petitions Committee</a> reviews all petitions we publish. They may press for action before your petition reaches 10,000 or 100,000 signatures.</li>
  <li>At 10,000 signatures you get a response from the government.</li>
  <li>At 100,000 signatures your petition will be considered for a debate in Parliament.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="debates">Debates</h2>

<p>Petitions which reach 100,000 signatures are almost always debated. But we may decide not to put a petition forward for debate if the issue has already been debated recently or there’s a debate scheduled for the near future. If that’s the case, we’ll tell you how you can find out more about parliamentary debates on the issue raised by your petition.</p>

<p>MPs might consider your petition for a debate before it reaches 100,000 signatures.</p>

<p>We may contact you about the issue covered by your petition. For example, we sometimes invite people who create petitions to take part in a discussion with MPs or government ministers, or to give evidence to a select committee. We may also write to other people or organisations to ask them about the issue raised by your petition.</p>

<h2 id="standards">Standards for petitions</h2>

<p>We’ll only reject your petition if it’s:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>not clear what you're asking for</li>
  <li>about something that the UK Government or Parliament is not responsible for</li>
  <li>about something that’s the responsibility of a devolved body (eg the Scottish Parliament)</li>
  <li>about a purely personal issue</li>
  <li>confidential, libellous, false or defamatory</li>
  <li>contains language that may cause offence, or is provocative or extreme in its views
deceptive or misleading</li>
  <li>advertising or spam</li>
  <li>nonsensical, or a joke</li>
  <li>party political</li>
  <li>about honours or appointments &ndash; there’s a different way to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/honours">nominate someone for an honour</a></li>
  <li>breaks the law or violates intellectual property rights</li>
  <li>covered by a court order, injunction or is about a case that’s active in the UK courts</li>
  <li>potentially confidential, commercially sensitive or might cause someone distress or financial loss</li>
  <li>names people working in public bodies (except for senior management)</li>
  <li>names family members of elected officials or people working in public bodies</li>
  <li>names someone who has been accused of a crime, or contains information that may identify them</li>
  <li>a Freedom of Information (FOI) request &ndash; there’s a different way to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/make-a-freedom-of-information-request">make an <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If we reject your petition, we’ll tell you why. If we can, we’ll suggest other ways you could raise your issue.</p>

<p>We publish the text of petitions that we reject, as long as they’re not illegal, offensive or confidential.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions, please <%= link_to 'get in touch', feedback_path %>.</p>

<h2 id="petitions-committee">The Petitions Committee</h2>

<p>The Petitions Committee is appointed by the House of Commons. It comprises up to 11 backbench Members of Parliament from Government and Opposition parties, and is calculated to reflect the membership of the House as a whole.</p>

<p>The Petitions Committee can:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>correspond with petitioners on their petition</li>
  <li>call petitioners for oral evidence</li>
  <li>refer a petition to the relevant select committee</li>
  <li>ask for further information from the Government, orally or in writing, on the subject of a petition</li>
  <li>put forward petitions for debate.</li>
</ul>
